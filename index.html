                            Tracy joined the Code4CT program in 2015 and then matriculated from Rustenburg Girls’ High in 2016. She decided to intern with Code4CT to give back to an organisation that had a large impact on her personal growth and development. During her time at Code4CT she facilitated coding classes, headed up the Ambassador programme and assisted with all program operations and logistics. She believes in helping young girls realize the potential they have to become game changers in their local communities.
